# Objects-size-measurement-using-aruco-marker
This project is all about Aruco Marker Detection and its application.in.real life.In this project we use python language, VS code as acode editor.We need a customed library named Opencv-contrib-python.
#Procedure:
Step-1: Environment set up.
For begenar programmer we need to installed python in system.After that we need to install the desired library opencv.For installing this library:type 
                                                "pip install opencv-contrib-python"
Inthe terminal.
Step-2:Coding procedure:
We have two python files here. First of all, We need to write arUco marker detection code.This code is recognised as "objets_detector.py" file.After that we need to write object size measurment code which is considered as main file and known as "measure_object_size.py" file.This code has been written based on haming algorithm that is used for measuring the size pf object.
